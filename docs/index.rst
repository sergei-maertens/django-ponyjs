   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least

Intended usage/public
---------------------
Django PonyJS is not meant to replace single-page-application (SPA) frameworks
like AngularJS, EmberJS, Backbone.js or maybe even ReactJS, if that counts.

It is aimed at developers who use Django views and templates for the major part,
and enhance certain pages/apps with client-side code. It's intended to be a
custom approach where a full blown SPA framework would be too much.


.. note::
  Django PonyJS is under heavy development. This means that this documentation
  may lag behind and that the (private) API might change without notice. However,
  we'll do our best to keep a changelog for early adopters.
